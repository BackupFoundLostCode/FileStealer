# FileStealer
My first attempt at C++.
The idea was to be able to search a PC for a file and then copy it to a USB drive. It works partially, but not all files are found even if they exist. This will be fixed when I get the chance. I would appreciate any feedback. 

At the moment, it only searches the Recycle.bin, which is the last major component that needs to be fixed in order to complete the programm. 
However, I haven't found a solution for this yet, as I first need to properly understand the library and folder structures in general.

It is now possible to search an entire list; simply paste it into NameList.txt. Each entry must be on a separate line.

(The letter of your USB device must be D).
